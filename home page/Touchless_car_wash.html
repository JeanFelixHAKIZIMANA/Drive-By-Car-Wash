    <h2>Touchless car wash</h2>
    <p>Like soft-touch car washes, touchless car washes are automated,</br> with the vehicle passing through a tunnel where it is cleaned. However,</br> touchless car washes do not use the foam or cloth applicators that soft-touch washes use,</br> instead relying on high-pressure washers to clean and rinse the vehicle. Sensors utilized by these washes allow for a more precise </br>clean along with the vehicle's exact shape.[14] To compensate for not physically contacting the vehicle, </br>touchless washes use higher pressures and more caustic detergents than ordinary car washes.[15] Because the vehicle </br>is not physically touched during a touchless wash, the vehicle is at a lower risk of being damaged. However, touchless washes </br>have a harder time cleaning off tougher materials or reaching difficult-to-reach locations on vehicles, and their usage of stronger chemicals </br>can potentially damage a vehicle's paint finish.</p>
